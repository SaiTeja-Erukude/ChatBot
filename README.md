# ChatBot

This Chatbot is built using Python ChatterBot library and Flask web framework.
ChatterBot uses a selection of machine learning algorithms to produce different types of responses which makes easy to automate conversations with users.
Flask is a popular Python web framework, meaning it is a third-party Python library used for developing web applications.

ChatterBot Corpus Trainer is used to quickly train the bot to respond to various inputs. My bot is trained on topics like AI, sports, humor, greetings, money, emotions, food, politics, literature, gossips, health, history etc.

One can also create a custom corpus training data and train their bot. My bot is also trained on how to assist the users in movie ticket booking process.
